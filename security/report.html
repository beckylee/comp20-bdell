<p><h4>Assignment 6 - Beckylee Dell</h4><hr/>
<p><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> ScoreCenter is a useful device store and view your proud moments in any computer or video 
games that you play.  Such an application requires a number of pages; a place to submit your
new highscore, a way to search for the champions of a particular game, and a way to search
for the scores of a certain user or player.  Young people have been playing games and 
comparing their high scores since the days of pong and frogger, this application simply offers
a high-tech, user friendly way to do so.
<p> For this assignment, I was asked to test and find the security limitations of the heroku
app found at <a href = http://peaceful-plains-9535.herokuapp.com/>http://peaceful-plains-9535.herokuapp.com/</a>
 by Michael Silberblatt. Before this ScoreCenter can be fully employed, it must be checked for
 any possible vulnerabilities and weaknesses.  The following is a brief account of the problems
 I found and possible solutions to fix these issues.

<hr/>
<p><h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>To test this application, first I attempted to manually find any weaknesses by going through
each page.  I checked for basic problems by attempting to overload the application with too much
data, submitting HTML tags, and trying to access the code.  Next, I tested the application using
third party programs, such as Burp and tktk.

<hr/>
<p><h3>Abstract of Findings</h3>
<p>(1)Limited amount of space/data available (Burp), but no restriction on how much data can be
inputted into the /new page.
<p>(2)anyone can delete all of the information using the /delete_all url.
<p>(3)
<hr/>
<p><h3>Issues Found</h3>
<p><h4>1. Not Enough Space & No Submit Size Limit </h4>
<ul>
<li> <b>Location: </b> /new
<li> <b>Severity: </b> Medium: A malicious user could incapacitate the site if they wanted to,
but even if the application was used properly, eventually it would run out of space.
<li> <b>Description: </b>  There is only 129 MB of space available on the ScoreCenter Database.
As well, there is no limit to how much input a user can submit for "username" or "game title."
The site could be incapacitated by receiving too much data.
<li> <b>Resolution: </b> I don't actually know?
</ul>
<p><h4>2. Anyone Can Delete the Database</h4>
<ul>
<li> <b>Location: </b> /delete_all
<li> <b>Severity: </b> High: Anyone, whether on purpose or by accident, can completely wipe out 
all of the database's information.
<li> <b>Description: </b> By simply visiting the /delete_all page, all of the ScoreCenter's
information is deleted.  
<li> <b>Resolution: </b>  Get rid of the /delete_all page.  It is openly accessible to anyone,
and holds great power.  Instead, rely on manual deletion or visit the Database on Mongohq
to clear it.
</ul>
<p>3.
