<p><h4>Assignment 6 - Beckylee Dell</h4><hr/>
<p><h3>Introduction</h3>
<p> ScoreCenter is a useful device store and view your proud moments in any computer or video 
games that you play.  Such an application requires a number of pages; a place to submit your
new highscore, a way to search for the champions of a particular game, and a way to search
for the scores of a certain user or player.  Young people have been playing games and 
comparing their high scores since the days of pong and frogger, this application simply offers
a high-tech, user friendly way to do so.
<p> For this assignment, I was asked to test and find the security limitations of the heroku
app found at <a href = http://peaceful-plains-9535.herokuapp.com/>http://peaceful-plains-9535.herokuapp.com/</a>
 by Michael Silberblatt. Before this ScoreCenter can be fully employed, it must be checked for
 any possible vulnerabilities and weaknesses.  The following is a brief account of the problems
 I found and possible solutions to fix these issues.

<p><h3>Methodology</h3>
<p>To test this application, first I attempted to manually find any weaknesses by going through
each page.  I checked for basic problems by attempting to overload the application with too much
data, submitting HTML tags, and trying to access the code.  Next, I tested the application using
third party programs, such as Burp and tktk.
