Frogger README

1. Everything works.  
   	      Additional requirements implemented:
	      - dead_frog.png shows up when the frog gets run over/in the water
	      - levels get progressively harder and faster until level 4.
	      - the lady frog floats along, and gives you 200 points if you 
	      	get her.  But she doesn't disappear afterw

2.  Phil Tang helped me recover lost data.

3.  Spent approximately 11 hours on the project.
