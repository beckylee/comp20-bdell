Lab 5

1.  The minutes on the timestamp don't include a 0 (12:05 is 12:5).  The new 
statuses aren't in list form like the rest of the old statuses are, but 
I decided to copy the format on the lab directions page.

2.  I got some help at the end of the assignment from Phil Tang, who graduated
last year.  I was having trouble inserting a new line between the statuses
and he helped me figure out what I was doing wrong.

3.  Approximately 2 hours.
