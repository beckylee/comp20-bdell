Beckylee Dell
Lab 11

1.  Web Programming (Comp 20) at Tufts University, Spring 2013.

2.  Favorite Project:  Frogger (assignment 4), because frogger is a fun game.

3.  What I'm most proud of:  Frogger, again.  By far the coolest thing I got to make.

4.  How much have I learned:  I learned a lot.  I came into this class knowing absolutely NO web programming, and only a little bit of basic C++.
