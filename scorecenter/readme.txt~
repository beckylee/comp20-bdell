1. The full frame of it is up, connects to mongodb, and it works on heroku!!
    User search returns all data from that user, but it's not pretty. Same with
    highscore and homepage (also, they're not in order).

 Basically, everything just shows up as a JSON api.

 JSON.parse isn't working, it keeps crashing my program.  Also, I can't really
    access the css files, so it's ugly.

2. Phil Tang has been explaining how a lot of things work.  
   Also, Tim Alander is a champ.

3. 16 hours and I lost track.
